# javascript-challenge

# Introduction
This project uses basic Javascript to create a simple web application which can retrieve UFO sightings data from the USA and Canada based on filtered date selections. The webpage was created using Javascript, HTML and Bootstrap. 

* Level 1: Automatic sightings table from date search. You can see the deployed visualization here.

# Data set
The complete data set can be found in the `data.js` file contained in the `static > js` folder of the directoy. This data set was provided by the boot camp program for assignment.

# Code information
This repository contains the folders `UFO-level-1`. To run this sript, make sure to have the complete `static` folder available in your working directory, since this contains the required `css`, `images`, and `js` to run the code.
